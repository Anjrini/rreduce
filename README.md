## rreduce

This script is a self-implemented code of the function "Reduce" in R.

## Libraries:

```
no library needed. We only to use the R base.
```

## The Funtion

the function is located in the file named "rreduce.R" and defined as follows:
```
rreduce<-function(x,y)
```
where:
- x: a vector of numbers
- y: a string containing "left" if the calculation is to be done from the left or "right" if the calculation is to be done from the right

## Running the Script

```
Line 8 : please change the variable "a" and "b" to the function of interest accordingly
Line 33: providing the vector x for the calculation of the right
Line 40: providing the vector x for the calculation of the left
```

## Exmaple

 I have provided an example using the function  $$y=\dfrac{1}{a} + b^2$$  as well as the following vector to be considered in the "rreduce" function $$(2, 1, 2, 1,-1)$$ from the right and left with the comparison with the "Reduce" function in R.
